Hello there! 
======
My name is *Yanwen Xia（夏彦文）*. My first name "Yanwen" means "outstanding" and "cultured" in Chinese, and my last name "Xia" means "summer". The pronouciation of my name in Chinese is similar to "yenwen share" in English.


Brief Introduction to myself
======
I am currently a senior undergraduate student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I will be a Phd student at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) in Sep 2025. I am lucky to be advised by [Prof. Chenxi Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=ESj_-bEAAAAJ). My research interests are in the area of computer systems, especially in the design and implementation of distributed and network systems.

Research Interests
======
- Solving *Computer System* problems with **Programming Languages** oriented approach.

Solve Computer System problems with Programming Languages oriented approach is a promising direction. Solutions include provide new programming abstracts, new programming models, new programming languages, etc. A famous example is *Spark* for big data processing. Recent works like *DRust*, *Midas*, *Nu*, *AIFM* and *Beehive* are also trying to solve some computer system problems with Programming Languages oriented approach.

- Runtime for *Disaggregated Memory*

Disaggregated Memory is a new architecture that aims to improve the data locality and reduce the resource racing problems of cloud applications running on the resource-disaggregated datacenter. Semeru[OSDI'20] is a famous project that implements Disaggregated Memory on top of RDMA.

- Distributed and Network Systems, Thread-level scheduling

User-level thread scheduling is a new research direction that aims to improve the performance of cloud applications by using user-level threads. Recent works like *Shenango* and *Caladan* are trying to implement user-level thread scheduling bypass the Linux kernel.

I am very willing to work with people who are interested in the above topics. If you are interested in collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me.

My hobbies
=====
- Playing Real-time Strategy games.
- Hiking.
- Music Fan of Chinese Pop, VOCALOID and J-POP.
- Watching movies and animes.
- Play new hardware and software.
- Tablet drawing.
