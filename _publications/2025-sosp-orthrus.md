### Introduction:
Even with substantial endeavors to test and validate processors, computational errors may still arise post-installation. One particular category of CPU errors transpires discreetly, without crashing applications or triggering hardware warnings. These elusive errors pose a significant threat by undermining user data, and their detection is challenging. This paper introduces Orthrus, a solution for the timely detection of silent user-data corruption caused by post-installation CPU errors.
